# Overview

E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an online store to identify top-selling products, calculate total sales, and evaluate sales performance by category. I am using a free dataset that aligns with my interests and provides meaningful insights for this analysis.

I obtained the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
